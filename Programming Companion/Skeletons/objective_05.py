""" Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. The program should
    output whether the two numbers are exactly divisible by each other. If not,
    it should return the remainder. If the user enters a 0 the program should
    give an error message (see the Programming Companion PDF for test data)."""

""" Write a program that lets the user enter a number between 1 and 12 and
    displays the month name for that month number and the number of days in the
    month. The input 3 would therefore display March has 31 days.

    Remember February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year.
    It is a leap year if the year is exactly divisible by 4."""
